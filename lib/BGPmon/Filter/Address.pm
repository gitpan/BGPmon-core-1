=head1 NAME

BGPmon::Filter::Address

This module is an object that keeps track of an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
It can compare two a prefix to itself to see if it belongs to that
prefix.

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use BGPmon::Filter::Address.pm

#To make an object with an IPv4 address, the first argument must be 4,
#followed by the address you wish to store.
my $ipv4_addr = new BGPmon::Filter::Address(4, "192.168.1.135");

#To make an object with an IPv6 address, the first argument must be 6.
#If you want to compare it with other IPv6 prefixes and return true when
#comparing for matches with less specific prefixes, the last argument must
#be 0.
my $ipv6_addr = new BGPmon::Filter::Address(6, "2000:0a00::");

#To compare the address to a prefixe, take the object and pass in the 
#prefix you want to compare it to.

#The following will return true since 192.168.1.135 is in 192.168.1.0/24.
my $ret_val = $ipv4_addr->matches("192.168.1.0/24"); # $ret_val will be 1

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS


=head2 new

This makes a new object.  You must pass in two arguments:

The version - 4 or 6

The address - e.g., "192.168.1.135"


To make an object that is for an IPv4 address of "192.168.1.135",
make the object with the following:

my $ipv4 = new BGPmon::Filter::Address(4, "192.168.1.135");

=cut
sub new{
	my $class = shift;
	my $self = {
		version => shift,
		address => shift,
	};

	my $temp = new Net::IP($self->{address});
	$self->{'netIP'} = $temp;

	bless ($self, $class);

	return $self;
}


=head2 matches

This will take in a prefix of the same type and test if that prefix 
holds this address.

INPUT: A prefix of the same type to be matched to, e.g, "192.168.1.0/24"
OUTPUT: 1 - true, 0 - false

=cut
sub matches{
	my $self = shift;
	my $prefixIn = shift;
	my $inPrefix = new Net::IP($prefixIn);	

	my $compVal = $inPrefix->overlaps($self->{netIP});
	if(!defined($compVal)){
        	return FALSE;
	}
	elsif($compVal == $IP_B_IN_A_OVERLAP){
        	return TRUE;
	}
	else{
		return FALSE;
	}
}

=head2 toString

Will return a string that can be printed in human readable form, e.g.,

192.168.1.35

INPUT: (none)
OUTPUT: A string of characters with information about the address.

=cut
sub toString{
	my $self = shift;
	return $self->{address};
}

=head2 getVersion

Returns the version of IP the prefix is : 4 or 6

=cut
sub getVersion{
	my $self = shift;
	return $self->{version};
}

=head2 isV6

Tests to see if the version specified is of type IPv6

INPUT: (none)
OUTPUT: 1 - true, 0 - false

=cut
sub isV6{
	my $self = shift;
	return $self->{version} == 6;
}

=head2 isV4

Tests to see if the version specified is of type IPv4

INPUT: (none)
OUTPUT: 1 - true, 0 - false

=cut
sub isV4{
	my $self = shift;
	return $self->{version} == 4;
}
